            <p>Hello, my name is Owen Trudt and I am currently a sophomore Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. This website was built for my Intro into Web Development course as a way to show case my projects and skills.</p>
            <p>Not only am I a student; I am a student-athlete. I currently am a player for the Rose-Hulman Men's Soccer program. And I am also a member of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, Photography Club and Anime Club. 
            </p>
            <p> In my free time you can find me reading a book, watching movies, playing video games, and at the soccer field training.</p>

            <p>Hello, my name is Owen Trudt and I am currently a Senior Computer Science major pursuing a minor in Image Recognition at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p>On campus I am a member of the Rose-Hulman Men's Soccer team, I am a brother of Triangle Fraternity, a member of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, and a teaching assistant for Web Development</p>
            <p>In my free time you can find me reading a book, watching movies, playing video games, or at the soccer field training.</p>
            <p>I became interested in computer science because of my Dad, he always pushed me towards STEM, I enjoy problem solving and computers so computer science became a natural choice as my major.</p>
            <p>I chose to pursue a minor in Image Recognition during my junior year, I had consumed different papers and media where the topic was computer vision and I believe where the industry is heading with AI needs image recognition. How else will these AI see?</p>
